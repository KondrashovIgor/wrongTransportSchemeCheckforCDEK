This code's input is an Excel list with typical data with parcels from warehouse A to warehouse B, and the output is the list of parcels were sorted wrongly (destination office from A != B)
This code was rather easy to do, but it saves about 22'000 rubles/week for the company, reducing the necessary operations from 2 hours to 10 minutes of data manipulation.
